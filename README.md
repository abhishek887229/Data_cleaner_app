# DataCleaner App 

This is a data analytics app designed to simplify the tasks of data preprocessing and feature engineering for individuals new to the field or those looking to excel in their work. Users can upload a CSV or Excel file, and the app provides basic analysis, imputation methods (both simple and advanced), feature selection, transformations, and basic visualizations. At the end, users can download the updated dataset.

## App Features:
1. **Basic Statistical Analysis and Visualization**:
   - Users can view basic statistics like mean, median, mode, the number of rows and columns, and distribution of data using KDE and box plots for both categorical and numerical data.

2. **Missing Value Handling**:
   - The app can handle missing values using various techniques, from simple imputation (mean, median, mode) to advanced methods like KNN imputation.

3. **Handling Duplicates**:
   - Users can easily identify and remove duplicate entries from their dataset.

4. **Data Transformation**:
   - Apply common transformation techniques such as normalization, standardization, one-hot encoding, and label encoding to prepare data for machine learning models.

5. **Feature Selection**:
   - Users can select specific features to keep or remove, aiding in more efficient model development and analysis.
